## A major problem at a minor scale
There are a vast number of extremely dire and alarming issues that the world (the younger generations in particular) are facing, and will continue to have to face in our lifetimes. A sense of hopelessness surrounds many, if not most, because as individuals there is very little we can do to deter the rapidly increasing affects of climate change, stop illegal behavior of the global elite, provide access to health care, food, and education for the underprivilidged, and provide a secure and accepting world for the next generation to grow up in regardless of their personal identity. 

There is a ideology that I believe in, however, that says before you can fix the world, you must fix your home, and before you can fix your home, you must fix yourself. And today, when so much of our lives moved so rapidly to this intangible digital space somewhere between on screen in front of us and all around us, we never really took the time to look at what was really happening and how it was affecting us. In the mental health revolution that has been occuring in recent years, I think it's time to look specifically at how we can improve our mental health by improving our relationships to our devices and the internet. 

## A dangerous vice

Building on my point from the introduction, the truth that so many of us are hooked on social media in particular is something that exhibits as an issue that is within us, and therefore something that we can and should focus on as a priority over other issues. Something that social media, and social media companies depend on is your willingness to make every problem your problem. That is what keeps your attention, and what makes them money. 

Our attention is the most valueable thing we have. Our inability to recognize or control how often we toss away hours upon hours mindlessly scrolling through walls of pictures and posts and links that do little to improve our lives is an epidemic. We weren't meant for 24 hours news and the constant bombardment of media, advertisement, and notifications. We must be diligent is recognizing when our relationship with the internet is harmful, and to make changes to support healthier engagement. 

So how do we do that?

## Deciding to be better

There are a number of ways to facilitate a healthier relationship between you and the internet, but ultimately it comes down to what works for you. We each interact with the internet in different ways, so what is enough for one person may not be for someone else. In her article, "Glued To Your Phone? Here's How To Rethink Your Relationship With Social Media," Mayowa Aina makes it clear that even though the thinking that our interactions on the internet are not _real_ that we should not take it for granted that these interactions do indeed have _real_ impacts on us and our wellbeing. Taking inventory of yourself, what kind of content you are consuming on your various media feeds, and what you yourself put out onto those feeds, may reveal things about yourself that you may not have even noticed and further aid in helping create better digital well-being. 

There are some other simple solutions you can do right now to help in limiting the amount of time spent aimlessly on your phone. If you struggle with spending hours and hours on your phone, many smartphones now include ways of setting daily limits on how much time you are allowed to spend on certian apps, or ways to schedule downtime from your phone altogether. 

Disabling notifications for anything that isn't from another human being is also a way of facilitating better use of your phone Apps with use notifications to simulate the feeling that another person has shared something with you in the attempt for you to open their application, and spend more time there. Reddit user StupidSoIDontGetIt shared the minutes spent on their phone before and after removing most notifications, and was able to reduce their screen time by almost 20%.

## Key points

The biggest thing you can do to improve your relationship with the internet and improve your digital wellbeing is to just pay more attention. Pay attention to what you use your phone for, when you use it, and where you use it. Pay attention to what you consume, what you read, and what you watch. Pay attention to what things browsing social media is replacing in your life, and if it is worth giving up that thing for time scrolling the feeds on your phone. 

The most valuable thing we own is our attention. With a limited time here on Earth, how and what we give our attention is our most precious commodity. Taking the time to evaluate and determine how to best utilize the many wonders of the internet allows while still maintaining a healhty relationship with it will be one of the most valuable skills for generations to come.
